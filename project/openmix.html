          content="In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering new classes in unlabeled visual data given labeled data from disjoint classes. Existing methods typically ﬁrst pre-train a model with labeled data, and then identify new classes in unlabeled data via unsupervised clustering. However, the labeled data that provide essential knowledge are often underexplored in the second step. The challenge is that the labeled and unlabeled examples are from non-overlapping classes, which makes it difﬁcult to build a learning relationship between them. In this work, we introduce OpenMix to mix the unlabeled examples from an open set and the labeled examples from known classes, where their nonoverlapping labels and pseudo-labels are simultaneously mixed into a joint label distribution. OpenMix dynamically compounds examples in two ways. First, we produce mixed training images by incorporating labeled examples with unlabeled examples. With the beneﬁt of unique prior knowledge in novel class discovery, the generated pseudo-labels will be more credible than the original unlabeled predictions. As a result, OpenMix helps preventing the model from overﬁtting on unlabeled samples that may be assigned with wrong pseudo-labels.

            Examples of (a) directly using MixUp among unlabeled samples and (b) the proposed OpenMix. Due to the
            uncertainty of pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples, their mixed labels may still have low conﬁdence. In
            OpenMix, the prior knowledge (area of high conﬁdence) leads the mixed label to have high (exactly true)
            conﬁdence in old classes and medium (reliable) conﬁdence in new classes.

                In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering new classes in unlabeled visual data given labeled
                data from disjoint classes. Existing methods typically ﬁrst pre-train a model with labeled data, and
                then identify new classes in unlabeled data via unsupervised clustering. However, the labeled data that
                provide essential knowledge are often underexplored in the second step. The challenge is that the
                labeled and unlabeled examples are from non-overlapping classes, which makes it difﬁcult to build a
                learning relationship between them. In this work, we introduce OpenMix to mix the unlabeled examples
                from an open set and the labeled examples from known classes, where their nonoverlapping labels and
                pseudo-labels are simultaneously mixed into a joint label distribution. OpenMix dynamically compounds
                examples in two ways. First, we produce mixed training images by incorporating labeled examples with
                unlabeled examples. With the beneﬁt of unique prior knowledge in novel class discovery, the generated
                pseudo-labels will be more credible than the original unlabeled predictions. As a result, OpenMix helps
                preventing the model from overﬁtting on unlabeled samples that may be assigned with wrong pseudo-labels.
                Second, the ﬁrst way encourages the unlabeled examples with high class-probabilities to have
                considerable accuracy. We introduce these examples as reliable anchors and further integrate them with
                unlabeled samples. This enables us to generate more combinations in unlabeled examples and exploit ﬁner
                object relations among the new classes. Experiments on three classiﬁcation datasets demonstrate the
                effectiveness of the proposed OpenMix, which is superior to state-of-the-art methods in novel class
                discovery.</p>
